                    <h2>The RYSA Mission</h2>

                    <p>
                         In all ways, the RYSA seeks to foster and uphold 3 core values:
                    </p>
                    <h3>Safety</h3>
                    <ul>
                         <li>The strictest safety guidelines will be followed for all events sponsored by the RYSA at
                              all times. The RYSA will not tolerate or allow any unsafe behavior.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Sportsmanship</h3>
                    <ul>
                         <li>The RYSA celebrates humility in victory, and grace in defeat. Out of respect for the sport
                              of Soccer, the RYSA will not accept unsportsmanlike behavior by children, guardians, or
                              any individual.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Inclusion</h3>
                    <ul>
                         <li>The RYSA aims to bring people in the community together. All individuals are welcome, and
                              all children between the ages of 4 and 14 are eligible to join a team. Coaches will be
                              instructed to ensure that all players on their roster are included and participate.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                         These three values, in order by priority, define the nature and purpose of our organization.
                         Please help us to maintain a positive environment at the RYSA.
