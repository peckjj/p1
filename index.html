                        Well, just kidding. We just wanted to grab your attention for the annual safety announcement!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It can get rough out there on the pitch. Even in the friendliest games, accidents are bound to happen that parents and guardians must be prepared to handle. Please refer to the following list of cautions to consider when preparing your safety measures:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mind the weather! Be sure to bring a suitable jacket for colder periods, and regardless of temperature, always bring plenty of water for you and your child.</li>
                        <li>Rain makes cold temperatures even worse. Always have some protective measures such as a rainjacket, umbrella, or pop-up canopy.</li>
                        <li>Respect the wildlife! While there have been no recent sightings of bears, they have been known to be in the area. Other creatures such as snakes are potential dangers as well. As you know or hopefully soon discover, the RYSA fields are surrounded by beautiful woods characteristic of the Rockville area. Educate yourself and your child on how to avoid or react to altercations with the surrounding nature.</li>
